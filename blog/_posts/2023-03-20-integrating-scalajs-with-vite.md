title: Integrating Scala.js with Vite
description: Using the new vite-plugin-scalajs to better integrate Scala.js with the Vite build tool.
---

One of the cornerstones of Scala.js is its ability to interoperate with JavaScript, in order to leverage its massive ecosystem.
At the language level, we have good foundations and good tooling (namely [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org/)) to reach out to JavaScript libraries.
However, at the tooling level, Scala.js remains centered around Scala tooling.
While this is good for the *coding* part of development, it is not so great for iterative feedback loops with the browser, or integration of other front-end assets.

The JavaScript ecosystem features a lot of great tooling in that respect.
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), in particular, is an interactive-first build tool for front-end development.
It provides live-reloading with fast refresh cycles.
Leveraging that tooling in the context of Scala.js would improve our ability to rapidly develop Scala.js applications.

In this post, we introduce [`vite-plugin-scalajs`](https://github.com/scala-js/vite-plugin-scalajs), a Vite plugin to integrate a Scala.js codebase into the Vite development pipeline.
In addition, we present a new tutorial series for Scala.js that integrates [Laminar](https://laminar.dev/) and ScalablyTyped with Vite.

## Past approach: scalajs-bundler

Several years ago, the Scala Center first developed [scalajs-bundler](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler/index.html).
Broadly, its goal was similar to what we present today: to integrate Scala.js with JavaScript tooling, in particular [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

scalajs-bundler is an sbt plugin that provides settings and tasks to orchestrate npm and webpack invocations.
The main premise was that Scala.js developers would be using Scala tooling first.
They would only want the JavaScript tooling as far as basic dependency management and bundling requirements were concerned.
With that premise, scalajs-bundler abstracts away npm and webpack to some extent, and is intended to be used from sbt.

While that approach works well for a while, it does not scale well to deeper front-end development requirements.
Soon enough, scalajs-bundler had to add support for custom webpack configuration files.
Unfortunately, using that feature meant that the webpack configuration was actually spread across sbt- and webpack-style configuration.

As time passed, best practices for Scala.js development evolved.
It became more common for Scala.js developers to use front-end tooling first.

## Vite and its usage in the Scala.js community

Last year, we surveyed what the best practices were among professional Scala.js users.
Several front-end build tools were mentioned, but [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) seemed to be a popular choice.
Vite leverages native support of ECMAScript Modules in browsers to provide fast edit-refresh cycles.
When saving a `.js` source file, Vite detects the change and sends a refresh command to the browser, which only needs to parse the changed files.

Building on ES Modules in this way provides a particularly nice opportunity for integration with Scala.js.
Indeed, Scala.js can be configured to emit small ES Modules out of the Scala code.
Even better, we can configure it to provide few large modules for dependencies (which rarely change), and small modules for the application code (which changes often).
Assuming the application lives in the package `my.app`, the required configuration is

```scala
scalaJSLinkerConfig ~= {
  _.withModuleKind(ModuleKind.ESModule)
    .withModuleSplitStyle(
      ModuleSplitStyle.SmallModulesFor(List("my.app")))
},
```

When we edit and save a `.scala` file, a chain of incremental build steps is triggered:

1. The Scala incremental compiler recompiles only that `.scala` file and produces the corresponding `.sjsir` files (the `.class` files of Scala.js).
2. The Scala.js incremental linker picks up the new `.sjsir` files, incrementally re-optimizes the application, and rewrites only the target `.js` modules that have changed.
3. Vite picks up the changed `.js` files and asks the browser to reload them.

In order to reinforce that effect, we recently brought significant performance improvements to the Scala.js linker, in particular in the incremental case.
Together with all the steps above being fully incremental, updating the UI of your application stays sub-second.

## Introducing vite-plugin-scalajs

To configure Vite to pick up the output of Scala.js, in `fastLinkJS` for development mode and `fullLinkJS` for production mode, we released [`vite-plugin-scalajs`](https://github.com/scala-js/vite-plugin-scalajs).
It is a plugin for Vite that directly connects it with a Scala.js sbt project (support for other Scala build tools will come later).

After installing with

```shell
$ npm install -D @scala-js/vite-plugin-scalajs@1.0.0
```

and enabling it in `vite.config.js` as follows:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import scalaJSPlugin from "@scala-js/vite-plugin-scalajs";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [scalaJSPlugin()],
});
```

we can import the output of Scala.js from `.js` or `.ts` files as follows:

```javascript
import 'scalajs:main.js';
```

`npm run dev`, the development mode of Vite, will automatically use the output of `fastLinkJS` in the Scala.js project.
Its production commands `npm run build` and `npm run preview` will use the output of `fullLinkJS`.

With this first version, a separate shell must be opened with sbt running `~fastLinkJS` for development mode.
As the plugin gets more usage, we will enhance it so that it can keep the `~fastLinkJS` itself in the background.

## New tutorial series

The release of `vite-plugin-scalajs` is part of a larger goal to simplify the developer experience in Scala.js.
TODO Update link to published version.
Together with the release of the plugin, we are also publishing a new [tutorial series to get started with Scala.js](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-website/pull/590).
This series covers the basics of starting a Scala.js project using Vite and the following technologies:

* [Laminar](https://laminar.dev/), a UI framework for Scala.js based on Functional Reactive Programming, and
* [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org/), a tool to automatically leverage TypeScript type definitions from Scala.js code.

If you prefer to watch content in video format, we have you covered:

* [Getting started with Scala js and Vite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv7fPmgFTNA)
* [Getting started with Scala.js, Laminar and ScalablyTyped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePrOa_1Am8)

If you always wanted to test Scala.js but were afraid of getting started, now is a good time to try!
We also have a community of friendly and helpful people in the `#scala-js` channel of the [Scala Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/scala).

## Conclusion

We presented [`vite-plugin-scalajs`](https://github.com/scala-js/vite-plugin-scalajs), a new plugin for Vite that wires it up with a Scala.js application.
Through nothing more than enabling the plugin in the Vite configuration, we can directly `import 'scalajs:main.js'` to get access to the output of Scala.js.
Vite's focus on module-based incremental updates combines particularly well with Scala's and Scala.js' own focus on incremental compilation and linking.
Together, they provide sub-second save-to-refresh cycles.

In order to help users get started with Scala.js and Vite, we published a [new tutorial series](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-website/pull/590).
It shows step by step how to integrate Vite, Scala.js, Laminar and ScalablyTyped to build a front-end application.
